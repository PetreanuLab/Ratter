%
% Main function for a WaterCalibrationTable! given a table, a
% valvename, and a desired dispense amount, it tries to calculate how
% much time the valve should be open in order to dispense that
% amount. Only locally linear calculations, near entries in the water
% table, are allowed. Anything further away produces a warning message
% and no result.
%
%     This function will crash if no reasonable interpolation can be produced
%       (i.e. if there are no table entries matching the requirements of
%       maxdays_error and maxdistance). Consequently, no error numbers are
%       returned.
%
% PARAMETERS:
% -----------
%
% wt        A WaterCalibrationTable object
%
% valve     A string identifying the name of the valve we're talking
%           about
%
% dispense  The desired dispense volume, in uL.
%
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
% --------------------
%
% maxdays_error   Any entries more than this days old are discarded from
%                 the table before any calculation begins. Default is 15,
%                 meaning that if you don't calibrate in 15 days, it is as
%                 if you had no entries at all!
%
% maxdays_warning   If no entries more recent than this days old, a warning
%                   is generated. Default is 10 days. Added by GF 12/19/06.
%
% maxdays_recent  Entries older than this are treated as old for the
%                 purposes of prediction during the calibration process.
%                 Old and new data points are treated differently, with new
%                 points having more bearing, and old points used only when
%                 new points are insufficient for good prediction of a
%                 pulse time for the next calibration round.
%
% maxdistance  Default 0.15. This is the maximum fractional distance
%              away from an entry in the water table that your request
%              can be. For example, say the only entry is for 20 uL,
%              and you ask for 23 uL. That is exactly 20*1.15 = 0.15
%              away, so you will get an answer. If, however, you ask
%              for 24 uL, the answer will be "I don't know-- too far
%              away from known points!"
%
% gui_warning  Default 0. If set to 1, then when there is no
%              well-defined answer (because of maxdays or maxdistance)
%              a little warning window saying so pops up. This window
%              does not halt other processing or anything, it just pops
%              up and quietly stays there until clicked away.
%
% calibrating  Default 0. Set this to 1 when calibrating - i.e. when the
%              estimation of a pulse time to deliver the requested quantity
%              of water is part of a calibration process. When 1, the
%              estimation employs extra logic intended to result in a
%              calibration process involving fewer trials by using new and
%              old data differently.
%
% linearfit_allpoints  Default 0. This generates a linear fit between the
%                      largest 2 entries in dispense volume and extrapolates
%                      the value for dispense from that fit.  If entries exist
%                      that surround the desired dispense value then a linear
%                      interpolation is used.  This is the standard old
%                      behavior before 2009-04-16.  Set to 1 to fit a line
%                      through all good values.  The dispense value is
%                      calculated from this line.  0 volume for 0 time point
%                      is included only if 1 good point exists (you need at
%                      least 2 points to fit a line). Chuck Kopec 2009-04-16
%
% use_mostrecent_day_only  Default 0. Data from all calibration sessions still
%                          in the WaterTable will be considered. This was the
%                          behavior prior to 2009-04-16. Set to 1 to only use
%                          data from the most recent calibration session.

% RETURNS:
% --------

%

% If no second argument is passed, then old_parse_style_flag takes the
% default value 1, in which case he entire string box concatenated into a
% single long string, no special syntax for line breaks or comments. So
% make sure to finish your statements with ";" if they are alone on a line!
%
% If a second argument is passed, and it is non-zero, then parsing is done
% new style: every row is treated as a separate line, and a ";" is added in
% between all lines. In addition, lines that start with "%" are treated as
% comments and ignored (they don't make it into the final output). Finally,
% to continue a Matlab statement across a line break, use "...". The
% ellipsis will be deleted from the final output.

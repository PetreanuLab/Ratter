* protection against range and double value errors in GUIs

* SoloFunction should change to SoloFunctionArgs

* Watch out for calling SoloFunction *after* function declared itself
  some vars-- they get erased! Fix this behavior...

* Added _history behavior on GetSoloFunctionArgs (make it a with
  history flag?)

* add bottom and top to Cpokes plot; and add cpokes histogram with key. Then
  we're done...

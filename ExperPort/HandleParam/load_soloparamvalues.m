%                               {'owner', ''}, {'child_protocol', []})
% Loads a 'data' file, which contains the value of all SoloParamHandles
% for the calling object, and sets the values of those SPHs to the value in
% the save file. Then calls all the callbacks for SPHs that had values that
% were loaded up.  
%
% If the obj parameter is ommitted, then the object for which SPHs will be
% loaded is defined using the optional parameter 'owner'. If that is empty,
% then determine_owner.m is called; this will return the class of the
% object that called load_solouiparamvalues.m. For backwards compatibility,
% the optional parameter 'child_protocol' can be an object, and the class
% of child_protocol is used; but 'child_protocol' is deprecated and will be
% phased out.
%
% PARAMETERS:
% -----------
%
% obj      The object that owns all the SoloParamHandles for which values
%          are now being loaded. For backwards compatibility, this
%          parameter is optional-- see comments on optional param 'owner'
%          below.
%
% ratname  A string identifying a rat for which the settings are being
%          loaded. This string is used to identify the default
%          directory and filenames in which to look, but the user is free
%          to use the interactive chooser to decide to load a different
%          file.
%
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
% --------------------
%
% data_file   By default empty. If empty, the default directory and so on
%          (see "iteractive" below) is used to determine the .mat file to
%          load. If data_file is not empty, then it should be a full
%          pathname for the data file that should be loaded. NOTE: a
%          non-empty data_file paramater supersedes interactive=1.
%
% experimenter   A string identifying the experimenter for which the
%          data are being loaded. This string is used to identify the
%          default directory and filenames in which to look, but the user
%          is free to use the interactive chooser to decide to load a
%          different file.
%
% interactive   By default 1: a value of 1 in this flag indicates that an
%          interactive file chooser menu will be displayed, and the user
%          can browse through the file tree and decide which file to load.
%          If this flag is passed as zero, then no chooser is displayed,
%          and the default file is loaded. The default file is
%             MainDataDir/Data/experimenter/ratname/data_@owner_experimenter_ratname_YYMMDDc.mat
%          where "YYMMDD" refers to the year, month, and day of the latest
%          such file that exists (but not later than today), and c is the
%          latest one-letter extension ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', etc.);
%          "experimenter" is determined by the optional pararmeter above;
%          "ratname" is the parameter above; @owner is typically a
%          protocol: e.g., "@Classical", determined by either the obj
%          parameter or the optional parameter "owner" below (see full
%          comments below); and MainDataDir is obtained from the Settings.m
%          system under the 'GENERAL'  'Main_Data_Directory' entry. 
%
% owner    A string identifying the owner of the SoloParamHandles that will
%          have their values loaded from the data file. This owner is
%          determined in the following way: First, if the param obj (see
%          above) is passed in, then owner = ['@' class(obj)]. Second, if
%          obj is not passed in, but the optional param 'child_protocol' is
%          passed, then owner = ['@' class(child_protocol)]. This
%          child_protocol param approach is deprecated and will be phased out.
%          Third, if the above fail, and the optional param owner was
%          passed in as a string, that string is used as the owner. An
%          initial '@' is prepended to it if it doesn't have one. Fourth,
%          if none of the above produced a string, determine_owner.m is
%          called to determine the class of the function that called
%          load_solouiparamvalues.m, and that is used as the owner string
%          (with a '@' at the front).
%
%
% rescan_during_load     By default empty matrix. If instead of empty we're
%          passed a cell (which should contain a list of SoloParamHandles),
%          then it means "IF you're in the middle of a load, check for
%          values of these guys only, then return. If you're not in the
%          middle of a load, just return."
%
%
% child_protocol   See comments for optional param 'owner' above
%
%
% RETURNS:
% --------
%
% success  This is retured as 1 if the settings were loaded, and as 0 if
%          they were not loaded (e.g., user hit cancel, or file not found,
%          or any other reason).
%
% filename The full filename, including full path, of the file that was 
%          loaded.
%
%
% EXAMPLES:
% ---------
%
%  load_soloparamvalues('B004', 'experimenter', 'Bing');

%  load_soloparamvalues('Lupin', 'experimenter', 'Shraddha', 'owner', 'duration_disc');
%

%
% The intent behind this method is to provide a time-sync signal on a DIO
% line, indicating start of a trial, for use by neural recording systems.
% That same signal is also used to indicate the trial number.
%
% When this method is called, the sma will be modified so that state_0
% will not jump straight to the user's first state, but will instead first
% go through a very swift sequence of states that put out, on one of the DIO
% lines, a binary signature of the number trialnum; after that, there is a
% jump to the user's first state. None of the user-defined states are
% changed by a call to this method.
%
% The signal on the DIO line will be: High,
% followed by a a 15-bit binary representation of trialnum (1 is High, 0 is
% Low), with most significant bit sent out first. That is, we go through a
% total of 16 states that cover both the initial sync signal and the
% trialnum. The default is to go through each of these states in 1/3th of a
% ms, twice the FSM's cycle time. This
% can be modified using the optional argument 'time_per_state'. All of
% these added states will have the name 'sending_trialnum'.
% 
% This method can ONLY be used with StateMachineAssemblers that were
% initialized with the 'full_trial_structure' flag. 
%
% The DIO line on which all this will happen is determined, by default,
% using the Settings.m system, with DIOLINES; trialnum_indicator being the
% setting name. For example, the line 
%      DIOLINES; trialnum_indicator; 32
% in Settings_Custom.conf would mean DIO line 6 (in binary, 32 is 100000,
% so it is the 6th bit). If no such setting is found, no DOut is generated.
%
%
% RETURNS: 
% --------
%
% sma      The updated State Machine Assembler object, after the
%          trialnum-sending states have been added.
%
%
% PARAMETERS:
% -----------
%
% sma      The instantiation of the StateMachineAssembler object to which
%          the new states will be added.
%
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
% --------------------
%
% 'time_per_state'    A scalar positive number indicating the time, in
%          seconds, that will be spent on each of the states, that put out
%          a signal. Default is 1/3 of a ms. Total time for all added
%          states will be time_per_state*(15+length(preamble)).
%
% 'preamble'  Sync signal that is sent before the trialnum. Default is
%         [1], meaning a single High bit.
%
% 'indicator_states_name'   String that defines the name of all the states
%          that will be added by this method. Default is
%          'sending_trialnum_data'.
%
% 'DIOLINE'  Default value is the string 'from_settings', which indicates
%          that the Settings.m system should be used to find setting named
%          DIOLINES; trialnum_indicator. However, you can use this optional
%          parameter to override the value from the settings files.

% Add a Scheduled Wave to the list of waves registered with the sma State
% Machine assembler object. Returns the updated sma object, and the name of
% the new scheduled wave.
%
% For an introduction to what scheduled waves are, see the section below
% entitled "WHAT IS A SCHEDULED WAVE." Note that as currently configured,
% you can have up to 32 different scheduled waves defined per state
% machine, no more. 
%
% 
% RETURNS: 
% --------
%
% sma      The updated State Machine Assembler object, after the scheduled
%          wave has been added.
%
% name     The name of the new added wave. This is a useful return
%          parameter if no name was specified when creating the new wave
%          (see below); here you can find out the unique name that was
%          automatically assigned to the new wave. (Usually, however, when
%          you don't specify a name, its because you don't care what it is 
%          and you don't need this return paranmeter.)
%
%
% PARAMETERS:
% -----------
%
% sma      The instantiation of the StateMachineAssembler object to which
%          the scheduled wave will be added.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
% ---------------------
%
% name      A string that will be the name of the new scheduled wave. If a
%           scheduled wave with this name already exists in this sma, a
%           warning and error will ensue. If this parameter is left empty,
%           then a new unique name for this sma will be created. 
%
%           To refer to the "In" and "Out" events for the scheduled waves
%           (for example, you might do this if you want to add a state from 
%           which such events trigger a state change), use name_In and
%           name_Out. After replacing "name" with whatever the name
%           actually is, of course.
%
% preamble  Time, in secs, which elapses before the scheduled wave is
%           triggered and its "In" event occurs. Default value is 1 sec.
%
% sustain   Time, in secs, which elapses between the scheduled waves' "In" 
%           event and its "Out" event. Default value is 0.
%
% refraction   Time, in secs, which elapses after a scheduled wave's "Out"
%           event and the time at which triggering it again is effective.
%           Before this time, triggering requests are ignored. Default
%           value of refraction is 0. [**must double-check that refraction
%           starts at "Out" event, not "In" event**]
%
% DOut      If non-zero, indicates which line on the DIO card will carry
%           the scheduled wave signal: during the sustain, this value will
%           be high (+5V). The actual line number will be log2(DOut), which
%           means that we can use values like Settings('get', 'DIOLINES',
%           'center1led'). Using DOut is therefore recommended over using
%           dio_line, for clarity, but the functionality of the two is
%           essentially the same.
%
% dio_line  Physical line on the DIO card that will carry the scheduled
%           wave signal: between preamble and preamble+sustain this line
%           will be High (+5V). [** Double-check that it is indeed +5**]
%           A value of -1 here indicates that the scheduled wave is purely 
%           virtual and doesn't correspond to a physical out line. Default 
%           value of dio_line is -1. If you want to use binary-encoded
%           values to indicate the dio_line, take the log2 of them first
%           (see DOut above).
%
% sound_trig   Sound ID of a sound to trigger when the sustain period of
%           this scheduled wave begins. The sound is turned off (whether or
%           not it has completed play) when the sustain period ends (i.e.
%           at the beginning of the refractory period). See examples below.
%           *NEW feature available in new-RT system
%           (June 2008; requires server running RTFSM version 100+)
%
% loop      The number of times the scheduled wave should repeat (i.e.,
%           after finishing the refraction, start the preamble again). The
%           default for this is 0, meaning the scheduled wave plays only
%           once. If a negative number is passed here, this means loop the
%           scheduled wave indefinitely, until the next trial start is
%           indicated by a jump to state 0.
%
% no_wave_events   By default, scheduled waves generate _In and _Out
%           events, at the end of the preamble and the sustain,
%           respectively. If this parameter is passed as 1, then te
%           scheduled wave being added will generate no events. (Default
%           for this param is 0, i.e., generate the events.) Suppressing
%           the events is useful when one is using a rapidly looping
%           scheduled wave that doesn't drive state transitions; for
%           example, for stimulus delivery purposes.
%
% trigger_on_up   By default, ''.  This entry indicates any scheduled wave
%           names that should be triggered when this wave goes High (i.e.,
%           goes from the preamble to the sustain. Use the names of the
%           scheduled waves, and use '+' to separate names if you want to
%           trigger more than one wave-- e.g., 'wave1 + wave2'. You cannot
%           UNtrigger waves here. To do that, see untrigger_on_down.
%
% untrigger_on_down   By default, ''.  This entry indicates any scheduled wave
%           names that should be UNtriggered when this wave goes Low (i.e.,
%           goes from the sustain to the preamble. Use the names of the
%           scheduled waves, and use '+' to separate names if you want to
%           UNtrigger more than one wave-- e.g., 'wave1 + wave2'. You cannot
%           trigger waves here. To do that, see trigger_on_up.
%
%
% EXAMPLES:
% ----------
%
% >> sma = add_scheduled_wave(sma, 'name', 'twosecs',  'preamble', 2);
%
%       Registers a scheduled wave called 'twosecs' that will have both "In" 
%       and "Out" events two seconds after being triggered, and has no
%       refractory period nor does it have a physical DIO line.
%          Later, to use such a wave, you might add a state in which its
%       start is triggered:
%          >> sma = add_state('output_actions', {'SchedWaveTrig', 'twosecs'});
%       And you later add another state in which the end of the preamble
%       triggers a state change:
%          >> sma = add_state('input_to_statechange', {'twosecs_In', ...
%                     'state_to_jump_to_when_twosec_preamble_finishes'});
%
% >> [sma, name] = add_scheduled_wave(sma, 'sustain', 3);
%
%       Registers a scheduled wave with the default preamble of 1 sec, a
%       wait between its "In" and "Out" events of 3 secs, and get back the
%       automatic name assigned by the assembler.
%
% >> [sma] = add_scheduled_wave(sma, 'name','telephone',            ...
%                               'preamble',0.01, 'sustain',1,       ...
%                               'dioline', 3,    'sound_trig', 1);
%       
%       Registers a scheduled wave named 'telephone' that plays the sound
%       with Sound ID 1 0.01 seconds (preamble) after being triggered and
%       simultaneously turns on DIO line 3 (e.g. turns on a light or
%       releases water). Both sound 1 and DIO line 3 are then turned off
%       one second (sustain) after they are turned on. There is no
%       refractory period in this case, so the scheduled wave can be
%       triggered again immediately after it stops.
%       
%<~>TODO: Look into the mechanics of the refractory period and
%           clear up the documentation above.
%<~>TODO: Add DOut comments below to the documentation above.
%
%
% WHAT IS A SCHEDULED WAVE, ANYWAY?
% ---------------------------------
%
% Scheduled waves are alarm clocks that you can set and use in your state
% machine. True finite state machines are very clear but quite limited;
% having these alarm clocks makes a number of things much easier to code,
% although it means our state machine isn't really a simple finite state
% machine any longer.
%
% A scheduled wave is defined by three parameters, which are specified when
% you register the scheduled wave using add_scheduled_wave.m these three
% parameters are: the 'preamble', the 'sustain', and the 'refraction.
%    When you trigger the start of a scheduled wave, preamble seconds
% elapse before anything occurs due to the scheduled wave. When the
% preamble time is over, an '_In' event from the wave occurs (and can be
% used in the state machine to trigger state transitions-- see
% input_to_statechange in add_state.m). After that, sustain seconds elapse,
% and then an '_Out' event occurs. After that, 'refraction' seconds elapse
% before you can trigger the start of a scheduled wave again (by default
% 'refraction' is 0).
%
% Most often, people use only the preamble, and use the scheduled wave as a
% simple alarm clock thatcan be made to trigger state transitions. As
% currently configured, you can use up to 32 scheduled waves.
